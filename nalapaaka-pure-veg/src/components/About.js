      <h2 className="aboutus-heading2">The Legend of Nalapaaka</h2>
      <p className="aboutus-content">
        The name "Nalapaaka" is inspired by the legendary figure Nala from the
        Mahabharata, one of the greatest epics of ancient India. Nala was a king
        of Nishadha, known for his unparalleled skills in the kitchen. His
        culinary expertise was so renowned that he was considered the best cook
        in all the realms. The word "Paaka" in Sanskrit means cooking, thus
        "Nalapaaka" translates to "Nala's Cooking." Nala's story is one of love,
        perseverance, and mastery. He was a skilled charioteer and an even more
        skilled chef, whose dishes were said to be infused with magic and love.
        Despite facing numerous challenges, including losing his kingdom and
        enduring hardships, Nala's culinary skills remained unmatched,
        symbolizing the essence of excellence and passion in cooking. At
        Nalapaaka, we strive to embody the same spirit of mastery and dedication
        in every dish we prepare.
